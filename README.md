# Hospital-Simulation
This project is a Discrete Event Simulation (DES) of a hospital system, implemented in Python. It models various hospital operations, including patient arrivals, doctor availability, treatment processes, and resource management. Simulates patient arrivals, reception queues and doctor consultations. Models hospital staff, including doctors and receptionists, along with resource allocation. Tracks patient waiting times and service efficiency. Allows customization of parameters to simulate different hospital scenarios. Can be useful for predicting patient wait times and improving overall patient experience. The simulation runs for 8 hours but can be easily changed.
