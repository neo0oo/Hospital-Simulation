# Hospital-Simulation
This project is a Discrete Event Simulation (DES) of a hospital system, implemented in Python. It models various hospital operations, including patient arrivals, doctor availability, treatment processes, and resource management. Simulates patient arrivals, treatment procedures, and discharge processes. Models hospital staff, including doctors and nurses, along with resource allocation. Tracks patient waiting times, service efficiency, and potential bottlenecks. Allows customization of parameters to simulate different hospital scenarios. Can be useful for predicting patient wait times and improving overall patient experience.
